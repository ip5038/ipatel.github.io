    <h1> The Avengers </h1>
    <h3> The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals with special abilities and the will to do good in the world. The team's purpose was to protect the planet Earth and its people from both domestic and extraterrestrial threats. They were a nonprofit organization privately funded by industrialist Tony Stark's Maria Stark Foundation. The group was recognized as a peacekeeping force by the National Security Council of the United States of America, the United Nations Security Council, and S.H.I.E.L.D.. The team functioned with the peaceful interests of the whole world rather than a specific country or organization as stated in the Avengers Charter.</h3>
